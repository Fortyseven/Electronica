Electronica is a simple, handy, Android-based reference tool for electronics, computers, and general DIY'ers. Includes formula calculations, component color code decoders, parts and cable references, and more!

Note: This was my second ever Android application; be kind on any bozo approaches I took -- I was just getting started.
