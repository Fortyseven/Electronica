This is EXTREMELY old code from when I first started working with Android and Java.

Completely unsupported.

I really liked this project (the best projects are ones you personally use!), and at the time it gained some minor popularity, but it turned out I wasn't willing to put in the time to keep it updated and fresh. Other, better supported apps eventually replaced it.
